  <h2>where i've been</h2>

   <p>I was born in kingston jamaica, but i have been in chicago for the past ten years. My mother wanted my sisters and I to become engineers or work in the field of technology, Soshe made sure my sisters and I attended enginnering school such as Miles Davis Magnet Academy, Jhonson College Prep, And now Robert Lindbloom Math And Science Academy. My mother also thought that it would be importantto keep us busy during the summer. Because of that i have been in many programs. These programs include Englewood Codes, Step Up (womens network, Future City Competition, Battle Of The Books, The Biggest Loser, R.A.G.E., The Recycle Protocall, Lego League, and Home cooking.</p>

   <h2>Where I'm going</h2>

   <p>I am currently a sophmore at Robert LindBloom Math And Science Academy. My goal is to attain a 4.0 Gpa so that I can apply and earn the Bill Gates scholarship for college.</p>

   <p>my motto is:if at first you dont succed try,try again! an di say that is my motto because i beleive that just because you didnt pass the test the first time doesnt mean that you wont pass it if you continue to try :)</p>
